This tune is one of the RoR basics. It is (together with ‘Samba Reggae’) the RoR Tune which sounds most like “real” Samba.

A lot of this tune is based on the Tamborim’s voice, which can be memorized by “I’ve got custard in my underpants”.
When learning the tune, start off there and make sure it’s burnt into everyone’s brain.

If you are playing Agogô or Tamborim, don’t mix up your voice with the one from afoxe, as they are very similar. Check
out the differences and find your way to remember them.

**Sign:** making an offer to the sky

## Background

Was formerly callled “Welfare State” but was renamed because people don’t like the state. The new name was taken from
the memory hook “I’ve got custard in my underpants.”

## Difficulty

* **Surdos**: medium
* **Repi**: medium
* **Snare**: medium
* **Tamb**: medium (easy to remember, very tiring)
* **Agogô**: medium (easy to mix up with afoxe)

## Breaks

* Break 1&2 are variations of the Tamb stroke in a call&response-way. In Break 1 the Surdos call, in Break 2 the Tambs.
* Break 3 can be used to have kind of solo parts for instrument sections: Let them continue while the others play Break 3.
  At the beginning you might need to count the bars in your head to find the transition back to the groove. This is most
  important for snare players as they have a solo in the last bar.
* Break 5 is a call&response between Snares and all others, which is really nice as an intro, or to speed up.
