A funny tune based on the famous song “Tequila” by The Champs.

The Surdos make together make the melody of the saxophone in the song. It is thus important for the sound of the tune to
time them right. The rhythm of Low Surdo is quite off-beat and can be easier to understand when copying the Mid Surdo
line using the hand. The High Surdo line is very simple, so it is an option for one person to play Mid & High Surdo
together.

The Surdo line has an upbeat, so when entering the groove (and Break 2), the Surdos always start a bit before the 1.

**Sign:** Shake salt onto your hand

### Background

Invented by RoR Berlin in 2017. Based on the song “Tequila” by The Champs ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3H6amDbAwlY)).

Tequila is an alcoholic drink made from blue agave in the region around the city of Tequila, Mexico. It was first made
in the 16th century by Spanish colonisers, inspired by Pulque, a traditional alcoholic drink made from fermented agave.
Outside of Mexico, it is common to lick salt and lemon from one’s hand before drinking Tequila, hence the tune sign.

### Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** tricky
* **Mid Surdo:** medium
* **High Surdo:** easy
* **Repi:** hard
* **Snare:** easy
* **Tamb:** easy
* **Agogô:** medium

### Breaks

* **Break 1:** Only Agogô, then everyone shouting “Tequila!”. Typically played after Break 2 or Bra Break, also sounds good
  after other 3-bar breaks, such as the Progressive Break.
* **Break 2:** The Surdos make the melody of the saxophone solo in the song. Typically, Break 1 is played afterwards. There
  is an upbeat of 3 strokes, so the Surdos start playing immediately after the 4th whistle.
* **Break 3:** Call&Response between Repis and everyone else. The same as the first half of the Agogô line. Typically,
  Break 1 is played afterwards.
