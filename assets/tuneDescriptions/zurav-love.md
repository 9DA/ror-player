Was drawn as the **Tune of the Year 2018**.

**Sign:** open and close the beak of a bird with your hands

### Background

Was introduced by RoR Kraków and RoR Trójmiasto on the TNM 2015 in Żuravlów. The tune name is a word play on the name
of the village.

Żurav means crane (type of bird), hence the sign.

The tune is based on the song “Truant” by British electronic musician Burial ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/j2Gppa-8hMA), parts with [Surdo+Tamb+Snare line](https://youtu.be/j2Gppa-8hMA?t=1m48s), part with [Agogo + Kick Back line](https://youtu.be/j2Gppa-8hMA?t=6m27s)).
