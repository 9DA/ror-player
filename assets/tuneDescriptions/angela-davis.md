This tune is one of the RoR basics.

In this tune, the Low Surdo swaps one of its beaters for a plastic Repinique stick (aka a whippy stick) to get a higher
pitched sound. Then it plays a combination of high-pitched and normal hits.

**Sign:** pull two prison bars apart in front of your face

### Background

The tune used to be called “James Brown” because the pattern of Break 1 (which is also used in Breaks 2&3) sounds like
the getting-back-from-the-bridge in “sexmachine”. It was changed due to the realization that James Brown had been
accused several times for domestic violence. The name “Angela Davis” refers to an american political activist
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis)). Apart from being involved in the black liberation movement,
she is also an anti-prison activist, hence the tune sign. The former sign (showing an Afro haircut) was changed due
to its racist connotation.

### Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** hard
* **Mid Surdo:** easy to remember, but hard to play it without beeing to fast nor to slow
* **High Surdo:** medium
* **Repi:** easy
* **Snare:** easy (there are some variations)
* **Tamborim:** easy
* **Agogô:** medium

### Breaks

* Break 1 consists of a pickup followed by a bar of eight-notes.
* Break 2 is a call&response between Surdos and everyone else, it is ended by the pattern of Break 1.
* Break 3 is a loop which is played by everyone except the Snare (which just continues its normal groove). At the end
  (or every time just before the Break starts again from the beginning) the pattern of Break 1 is played.

Combinations of Angela Davis and Funk sound nice (changing between both, introducing break of one on the other, etc.).
In fact, Angela Davis is a kind of funk too.
