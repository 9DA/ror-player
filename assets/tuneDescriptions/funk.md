This tune is one of the RoR basics.

This tune is played over 8 beats instead of 4, so take care when counting in.

Although is the only tune called Funk, is not the only that sounds “funky”. There are two other, Karla Shnikov and
Angela Davis. Just try to combine them, especially Funk-Angela Davis sounds great.

**Sign:** glasses on your eyes

### Difficulty

Good to begin with, because all instruments are quite easy:

* **Surdos**: easy (all surdos play the same line and there are tons of memoryhook-phrases)
* **Repi**: medium (the repi is not that easy, but anyway it’s a good tune to begin with, because you find different repi-hits)
* **Snare**: easy
* **Tamborim**: easy
* **Agogô**: easy (because they can look at the surdos for almost any hit they play)

### Breaks

* Break 1, which is a call & response-break between Surdos and all others
* Break 2, where everyone plays one bar of eighth-notes
* Call Break, two breaks wich are played the same way (five hits in the beginning) but end with a shout of either “oi!”
  or “uah!”. They can be used in almost any tune, not just this one. Some bands play around with the shouting break by
  using other shouts in the end. This way it’s also possible to connect a political output to this breaks.
