**Sign:** scratch your head and your armpit at the same time like a monkey

## Background

Composed by someone from RoR Vienna during his time in Tanzania in 2011. It incorporates rhythms from different styles
of pop music that young people were listening to at the time. The name is inspired by a group of monkeys who fequently
visited the garden to steal things. The name of the Bongo Breaks comes from the popular type of music "Bongo Flava".

## About the tune

Is a very happy tune and quite new. It was introduced at the TNM 2010.

## Breaks

Break 1: It is over 16 counts and a call response. The Agogô plays part of their line and all others respond. Then
there is a part where everyone (including Agogô) plays. and in the end the Mid Surdo picks up.
