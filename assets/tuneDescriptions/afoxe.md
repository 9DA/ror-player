This tune is really going forward: The Low Surdo is pushing with techno-like damped hits, while the Repinique and Snare
voices are one of the most fancy – and also most difficult – ones in the RoR repertoire.

One thing to note is that while most of the instruments have parts that are played over 4 beats, the Surdos and Repi
have a pattern played over 8. It is important to call breaks etc. at the right time. The Repinique part is rather hard
as some notes are hit with a flare, some with the hand near the rim of the drum, and some notes played on the rim. It
takes a bit of practice, but once you’ve got it, it sounds fantastic.

The tamb part can be remembered by “1 2 3 4 What Are We Here For”. Be careful though – it is quite easy if you’re not
concentrating to slip into the tam part of Custard. If you maestre, think about the tamb players. This song can be very
tiring for them so give them a break once in a while.

**Sign:** Shaving the armpit

### Background

Afoxê is “an Afro Brazilian genre of music” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afox%C3%AA)).

The sign comes from the name sounding similar to "After-shave" (when pronounced with an English accent).

### Difficulty

* **Low Surdo:** easy
* **Mid/High Surdo:** medium (they play the same…)
* **Repi:** hard (contains many variations in tone and speed)
* **Snare:** hard (while it’s on beat in the beginning it’s getting some offbeat in the end)</dd>
* **Tamb:** medium (quite exhausting if played for a long time)
* **Agogô:** medium (easy to mix up with custard)

### Breaks

* Break 1, a call&response between Surdos and all others
* Breaks 2 & 3 which are exchange-surdo-lines for Mid and High Surdos
* Bra Break, a call&response between Repis and all others
* Wolf Break, a call&response between Surdos and all others which ends with a (name giving) howl. It is usually played
  in a loop. Can also be played in other tunes.
