This tune is one of the RoR basics. Often simply called “Karla”.

It sounds a bit, as the name implies, like machinegun-fire. As the Breaks have steady drum rolls in them, it’s important
to aim for a steady even roll. Although the temptation is to play as fast as you can, you should try to be just in time
(highlighting the first hit on every step can be helpful, to keep track).

Karla Shnikov is a funk tune too, but it does not fit with the other funks (Funk and Angela Davis) as well as they do
together. But just try and find your own way!

**Sign:** move index+middle finger like rabbit ears and cover other fingers with other hand


### Background

Used to be called “Kalashnikov”, but was changed between 2014 and 2015 because some bands were getting in trouble for
showing the sign (finger pistol).

“Karla Shnikov” is a fictional character invented on the TNM 2014 to have a story for the new tune name. She was a lover
of Trotzky but later became an anarchist. She was also an animal liberation activist and liberated the biggest rabbit
farm in the Soviet Union (hence the tune sign). 

### Difficulty

### Breaks

Karla Shnikov has 3 breaks, one called just Karla Break (aka break 1), Break 2, and its inverted variation.

Karla Break is a quite common break, which can be played in every other tune. it consists of three bars of 4 hits per
beat (for instruments which only have one beater it’s better to play 2 hits per beat) followed by a fourth bar where
only the first sixteenth is played and the rest is silence. This Break creates a lot of tension. It’s also possible to
let one instrument section continue playing it’s normal rhythm (for most instruments it sounds pretty awesome).

Break 2 consists of one bar with sixteen notes, played from soft to loud in group of four, then another bar with one
note on time on each beat, and then two call & response bars.

Break 2 inverted consists in playing break 2 forward and then backward (that is, 4 up, 4 beats ontime, 2x call&response,
2x call&response, 4 beats ontime, 4 down).
