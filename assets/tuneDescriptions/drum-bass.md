Sounds more like Hip-Hop than Drum ‘n’ Bass but has a really nice groove. Can be very cheerful when played quite fast
or be groovy when played slow.

The Low Surdo is very important in this tune because it gives the special hip hop rhythm and “carries” the tune. There
are different versions on the tune sheets but both sound good ;). Since none of the Surdos play at the same time, it is
also possible to play this tune with only one or two surdo players and three surdos. To remember the Surdo lines it is
also helpful to sing them all together (low, high, middle middle, low, high-low, low, high, middle middle, low, high…).

**Sign:** With one hand in your ear lift the other and move it front and back (like a DJ).

### Breaks

* Break 1 is a singing break (no drumming, all sing together "everybody dance now!”), brings a good mood and moves and
  can be used to involve audience. This break can be played in all other tunes as well.
* Break 2 is similar to the “Kick Back 2 Break” from the tune Ragga. Be aware that only repi and snare play on the 8th
  beat before it goes back into the tune.
* Break 3 is a little tricky but once mastered, sounds really nice.
* The Progressive break is quite easy and can creates tension. With the special hand sign for this break it is easy to
  include it while playing other tunes.
* The Hip Hop Break (the hand sign is supposed to look really cool hip-hop-stylish, everyone does it their way) sounds
  really groovy but is also quite tricky for the surdos (a memory-hook phrase is helpful).
