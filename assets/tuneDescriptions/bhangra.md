If the players or the audience needs a rest, Bhaṅgṛā is a good tune to play.

But be aware of the 6/8 rhythm. On the notation sheet, every step is divided into only 3 hits (instead of 4 in the 4/4).
When playing it for the first time, you might have to concentrate in order to not get stuck in the usual 4/4 rhythm.
This is particularly important when switching from or into a different tune.

If you play breaks from other tunes which are based on 16hits in a 4/4-pattern (eg. “kalashnikov-break”, or “8up”) try
to play 12hits in a 3/4-pattern. in the beginning it’s quite hard (because the 4/4 is stuck in your head) but after a
while it’s great – make sure tho whole band plays like this, if some plays it differently it can get very chaotic…

## Background

Bhaṅgṛā is a style of pop music invented by Punjabi immigrants in Great Britain and North America
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhangra_(music))).

## Difficulty

* **Surdos:** easy
* **Repi:** easy
* **Snare:** easy
* **Tamb:** medium
* **Agogô:** easy

## Breaks

* Break 1 and 2: are very similar, but luckily, there are memory-phrases to help you memorize and distinguish them.
  Singing them together in a rehearsal is also a good idea. (btw: papadam is an indian bread)
* Break 3: is a variation of the Agogô voice; everyone just plays the Agogô rhythm on one tone. The pause at the end
  of the normal Agogô voice is not taken into account.
* Bra Break: where the Repi calls and everyone else answers. There’s an intermezzo, where the Surdos play something
  similar to the Tamb-stroke and at the end everyone shouts “ey”. While it seems really hard to learn at first, you’ll
  see that the break will be stuck in your ear already after you heard it a few times.
