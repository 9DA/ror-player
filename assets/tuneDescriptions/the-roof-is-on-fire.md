**Sign:** Form a roof with your hands, interlace the fingers and wiggle them like flames.

### Background

This Tune was spontaneously invented by RoR Kaunas during the TNM 2019 after the roof of the sauna caught fire.

It is based on the song “Fire Water Burn” by the Bloodhound Gang ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adgx9wt63NY)), which covers the chorus of the song “The Roof Is on Fire” by Rock Master Scott & the Dynamic Three ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/-Vv_LwwwpmU?t=263)).
